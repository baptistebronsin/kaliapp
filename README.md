# Kaliapp

Kaliapp is a simple NextJS application made during my first month at [Kaliop](https://www.kaliop.com/fr/) to learn the framework and its features. It's a quiz app where users can answer questions, see their scores and create their own quizzes.

Unfortunately, I lost the original repository and this version is not finished. However, it still contains some interesting features.

[!WARNING]
This application doesn't have any backend or database, so all data is stored in memory. If you refresh the page, all data will be lost.

## Usage

To run the application, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    cd kaliapp
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
